# Grand-PriIEEE-STOOPS

Dear Grand PrIEEE Teammates,

Welcome to our GitHub repo! We haven't been using it much, but from here on out I will keep my progress on our code here so that you can always edit my most recent progress. I encourage you to do the same :)

Take a look at the commit messages for the files I just added to see where we're at. You can also peek at the "TestPlan" file in ./Code to see what my next steps will be. Obviously, you are free to edit everything at will, just keep it clear which parts are yours. The nature of Git helps with that immensely.

If you need/want a git crash course, hit me up. I'm not a master, but I can get around and teach you the basics.

Love,

Staz
