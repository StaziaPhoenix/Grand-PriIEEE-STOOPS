TestPlan
Undated, vaguely ordered.

1) Configure Staz-Pi for openCV stuff, so we have two functional processors.

2) Test ImageAalyze stuff for error detection
		+	Estimate pixel to centimeter conversion based on our webcam, see
			if estimate yields results within our tolerance.
		+	Decide on a height and downward angle at which to mount the webcam
			on the car - once these are decided, we have two less unknowns
			to test.
		+	For each calibration attempt (currently, only one in queue is
			px -> cm conversion), record returned angle and holistic accuracy.

3) Encode the and and motor level for sending to the Arduino.
